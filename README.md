# Snake Game

## Project Overview

This is a classic Snake game implemented in C++ using the `clui` library for color and input handling. The game features two players controlling their snakes on a grid, with the goal of growing their snakes by eating apples while avoiding collisions with walls, bombs, and each other.

## Features

- **Two-player Mode:** Players control two snakes simultaneously.
- **Apple Eating:** Snakes grow in length when they eat apples.
- **Bombs:** Bombs appear on the grid, and snakes must avoid them.
- **Customizable Game Speed:** Players can choose from fast, medium, or slow game speeds.
- **Score Tracking:** Scores are tracked for both players and displayed at the end of the game.
- **User Management:** Users can add new usernames and update existing ones.
